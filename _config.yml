resume_header_intro: "<p> My research interests include natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in employing deep learning in different applications of natural language processing especially sentiment analysis. The field of opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, has become active in recent years. Since different kinds of deep neural networks differ in their structures, they are probably extracting different features. Investigating whether features generated by heterogeneous deep neural networks can be combined by multi-view learning to improve the overall performance is a follow-up research work. I am also interested in the following topics: </p><h4>Deep Learning:</h4><ul class='resume-item-list'><li>Sequence to Sequence Models</li><li>Convolutional Neural Network</li><li>Recursive Neural Network</li><li>Recurrent Neural Network</li><li>Generative Adversarial Network</li><li>Semantic Word Embedding</li><li>Multi-task Transfer Learning</li><li>Reinforcement Learning</li></ul><h4>Information Retrieval:</h4><ul class='resume-item-list'><li>Web Document Ranking</li><li>Query Reformulation</li><li>Understanding User's Query Intent</li><li>Clustering/Classification</li></ul><h4>Natural Language Engineering:</h4><ul class='resume-item-list'><li>Sentiment Analysis</li><li>Machine translation/Transliteration</li><li>Semantic Relatedness</li><li>Topic Modeling</li></ul>"
